## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Instant Apps

I began by searching ArcGIS Online for a suitable web map and found the "Rondonia Land Cover Change from 1992 to 2020" map. With this as my foundation, I moved to Instant Apps and selected a template that allowed users to interact with and compare the data over time. The Media Map template was perfect for this purpose. 

In the Search Settings field, I selected the Swipe tool and turned off the Express Mode window. For the Leading Layers pane, I chose "Rondonia Land Cover 2020_CLIM," and for the Trailing Layers pane, I selected "Rondonia Land Cover 1992_CLIM." This setup enabled a side-by-side comparison of the two maps using a slider tool, which I positioned at 15. 

Next, in the Configuration panel under Theme & Layout settings, I changed the theme to dark and fixed the header to display the app title. I also added multiple language options to ensure broader accessibility. Finally, I published the web app, completing an interactive and visually engaging tool to showcase the land cover changes in Rondonia over nearly three decades.

## Lessons Learned:

I discovered the process of sourcing web maps into an interactive app using ArcGIS Instant Apps. This tool proved to be incredibly handy, requiring minimal maintenance and allowing for quick creation. I felt a sense of accomplishment, much like a front-end developer, as I built and sustained an app that was up-to-date, functional, and user-friendly.

Moreover, I was thrilled to learn something new, expanding my skill set and eagerly anticipating future opportunities to apply these skills. The experience was both empowering and exciting, opening new avenues for creativity and professional growth.
